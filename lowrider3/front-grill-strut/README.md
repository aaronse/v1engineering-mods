### Purpose
- Generate a fancy custom, but practical, stronger, solid front grill strut for your [V1Engineering LowRider 3](https://docs.v1engineering.com/lowrider) CNC.
- Honestly, I initially used this as a practical opportunity to learn some [OpenSCAD](https://www.openscad.org/).


### Usage:
- See code comments for usage instructions.  Here's a (stale?) snapshot for convenience :

### Notes:
Written/tested on Windows.  Might work on Linux/Mac too, good luck! :-)


### Acknowledgements
- Remix/based-on [Jamie's script](https://www.printables.com/model/206716-lr3-strut-plate-variable) for creating variable length struts designed for V1 Engineering's Lowrider 3.
