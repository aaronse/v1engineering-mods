## Features
- This remixed Dust shoe is compatible with the original dust skirt and TPU Bristles.  
- Can see the cut, mister and chips flying left towards the Vac hose.  Vision on right side is  bit restricted so we could reuse existing dust skirt and bristles.
- Can easily inspect/view the router bit while standing up, even without a Camera being used.  No more bending over or neck strain while watching long jobs…
- GoPro Camera compatible, recommend macro lens able to focus at 8cm (e.g. [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C9GTKLF9](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C9GTKLF9) ).  Just rest Camera on the mount, no need to bolt or strap easy to remove.
- Includes wedge mount, mount holes and generous ledge enabling other Cameras to be mounted.  I've not made any adapters, hopefully others will.
- Rounded finger friendly profile enables easy fast fumbling for the spindle lock.
- Includes mount to precise placement of air/coolant mister mount even if dust skirt is attached.
- Increased material for secure mount to router clamp.
- Kobalt router has LEDs, so I've tried to minimize thickness of material enabling maximum light to shine through when using transparent filament.
- When not watching/filming, for maximum suction, can cover view port hole using TPU/PETG GoPro lens cap like https://www.printables.com/model/1327169-gopro-hero-13-mini-lens-cap-printed-tpu-06mm-nozzl


## How to print
- Print using same slicer settings guidance as original LowRider 4 CNC Dust shoe for Kobalt routers… https://www.printables.com/model/1034828-kobalt-tool-mount-and-dust-shoe-for-the-lowrider-4 .  
- No support required, but…  Make sure your bridging and overhang settings are reasonably dialed in.  Consider PETG, I use 2 wall, 30% infill, 0.6mm nozzle, 0.32mm layer height.
