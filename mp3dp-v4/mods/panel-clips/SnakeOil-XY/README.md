# Panel Clips, based on SnakeOil XY Printer

.STEP, .STL files in this folder not prefixed with "aza-" were copied as-is from https://github.com/SnakeOilXY/SnakeOil-XY

.gcode files were generated for my MP3DP v4.

~2023/7/12 Chatted with SnakeOil folks to thank them for their work, and to mention I was copying/forking it :-)  See chat here...  https://discord.com/channels/851371040566673428/1099981139541774407/1128540428900249631
